# Laser - provides basic control of ThorLabs 4-Channel Fiber-Coupled Laser Source
#
# Matthew Grossman from Princeton HCIL - Jun. 5, 2018
# Based on a Matlab function developed by He Sun
#Brief Usage:
#    To enable the laser:
#       # specs is an optional dictionary of default values to change
#        laser = Laser(specs) 
#        laser.enable()
#    To disable the laser:
#        laser.disable()
#    To get the status of the laser:
#        status = laser.status
#    To change the current of the laser:
#        laser.changeCurrent(current, channel)
#        # Channel   |   Max Current
#        # 1         |   68.09
#        # 2         |   63.89
#        # 3         |   41.59
#        # 4         |   67.39
#    To calibrate the laser:
#        center, secondary = laser.calibrate(image, length, camera)
#       # length defines the size of the area that is searched for a guassian
#       # length = 10 seems to work. camera is the an isntance of Camera class
